Support
=======

There are three support mechanisms for Calico:

-  Mailing list. This is for questions about Calico, or for asking for
   help.
-  Issues. These are for problems with Calico. If you're not sure
   whether a certain behaviour is expected or not, you should ask on the
   mailing list first.
-  Pull Requests. These allow you to contribute fixes and enhancements
   back to Calico.

Mailing List
------------

The mailing list is managed
`here <http://lists.projectcalico.org/listinfo/calico>`__. When posting,
please try to:

-  provide a clear subject line.
-  provide as much diagnostic information as possible.

You're much more likely to get your question answered quickly and
correctly that way!

Issues
------

Calico uses GitHub's Issues system to track problems. To access the
Issues system, first determine which project the issue is with - ask in
the mailing list if you're not sure. Then go to that project's
repository page in GitHub and click the Issues tab at the top.

Remember to do a search for existing issues covering your problem before
raising a new one!

Pull Requests
-------------

Calico follows the "Fork & Pull" model of collaborative development,
with changes being offered to the main Calico codebase via Pull
Requests. If you're interested in contributing,

-  thanks!
-  see the `GitHub
   docs <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`__ for
   how to create a Pull Request
